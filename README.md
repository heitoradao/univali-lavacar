## univali lavacar simulation

![screenshot](docs/screenshot.png "screenshot")

This is a Qt/C++ producer-consumer stochastic simulation, for a college project.

It was written in 2012 with Qt 4.8.
It doesn't compile with modern Qt versions.
I don't know why, but it's not on my top priorities, for now.
Maybe in my spare time I revisit it and make it more generic.
Or post here the proposed problem.
It's hidden in some old HD with IDE interface.

The source code and interface are in pt_BR.

## My conclusions for this project

If I ever need to make some stochastic simulation works in future, I would totally go for [OMNeT++](https://omnetpp.org/).
